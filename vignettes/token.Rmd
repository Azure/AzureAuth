This is a short introduction to authenticating with Azure Active Directory (AAD) with AzureAuth.

## The `get_azure_token` function

The main function in AzureAuth is `get_azure_token`, which obtains an OAuth token from AAD:

```r
library(AzureAuth)

token <- get_azure_token(resource="myresource", tenant="mytenant", app="app_id",
    password="mypassword", username="username", certificate="encoded_cert", version=1, ...)
```

The function has the following arguments:

- `resource`: The resource or scope for which you want a token. For AAD v1.0, this should be a single URL (eg "[https://example.com](https://example.com)") or a GUID. For AAD v2.0, this should be a vector of scopes (see below).
- `tenant`: The AAD tenant.
- `app`: The app ID or service principal ID to authenticate with.
- `username`, `password`, `certificate`: Your authentication credentials.
- `auth_type`: The OAuth authentication method to use. See the next section.
- `version`: The version of AAD for which you want a token, either 1 or 2. The default is version 1. Note that the _OAuth scheme_ is always 2.0.

Scopes in AAD v2.0 consist of a URL or a GUID, along with a path that designates the scope. If a scope doesn't have a path, `get_azure_token` will append the `/.default` path with a warning. A special scope is `offline_access`, which requests a refresh token from AAD along with the access token: without this, you will have to reauthenticate if you want to refresh the token.

```r
# request an AAD v1.0 token for Resource Manager
token1 <- get_azure_token("https://management.azure.com/", "mytenant", "app_id")

# same request to AAD v2.0, along with a refresh token
token2 <- get_azure_token(c("https://management.azure.com/.default", "offline_access"),
    "mytenant", "app_id", version=2)
```

## Authentication methods

AzureAuth supports four distinct methods for authenticating with AAD: **authorization_code**, **device_code**, **client_credentials** and **resource_owner**.

1. Using the **authorization_code** method is a multi-step process. First, `get_azure_token` opens a login window in your browser, where you can enter your AAD credentials. In the background, it loads the [httpuv](https://github.com/rstudio/httpuv) package to listen on a local port. Once you have logged in, the AAD server redirects your browser to a local URL that contains an authorization code. `get_azure_token` retrieves this authorization code and sends it to the AAD access endpoint, which returns the OAuth token.</p>
The httpuv package must be installed to use this method, as it requires a web server to listen on the (local) redirect URI. Since it opens a browser to load the AAD authorization page, your machine must also have an Internet browser installed that can be run from inside R. In particular, if you are using a Linux [Data Science Virtual Machine](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/virtual-machines/data-science-virtual-machines/) in Azure, you may run into difficulties; use one of the other methods instead.

```r
# obtain a token using authorization_code
# no user credentials needed
get_azure_token("myresource", "mytenant", "app_id", auth_type="authorization_code")
```

2. The **device_code** method is similar in concept to authorization_code, but is meant for situations where you are unable to browse the Internet -- for example if you don't have a browser installed or your computer has input constraints. First, `get_azure_token` contacts the AAD devicecode endpoint, which responds with a login URL and an access code. You then visit the URL and enter the code, possibly using a different computer. Meanwhile, `get_azure_token` polls the AAD access endpoint for a token, which is provided once you have entered the code.

```r
# obtain a token using device_code
# no user credentials needed
get_azure_token("myresource", "mytenant", "app_id", auth_type="device_code")
```

3. The **client_credentials** method is much simpler than the above methods, requiring only one step. `get_azure_token` contacts the access endpoint, passing it the credentials. This can be either a client secret or a certificate, which you supply in the `password` or `certificate` argument respectively. Once the credentials are verified, the endpoint returns the token. This is the method typically used by service accounts.

```r
# obtain a token using client_credentials
# supply credentials in password arg
get_azure_token("myresource", "mytenant", "app_id",
                password="client_secret", auth_type="client_credentials")

# can also supply a client certificate as a PEM/PFX file...
get_azure_token("myresource", "mytenant", "app_id",
                certificate="mycert.pem", auth_type="client_credentials")

# ... or as an object in Azure Key Vault
cert <- AzureKeyVault::key_vault("myvault")$certificates$get("mycert")
get_azure_token("myresource", "mytenant", "app_id",
                certificate=cert, auth_type="client_credentials")
```

4. The **resource_owner** method also requires only one step. In this method, `get_azure_token` passes your (personal) username and password to the AAD access endpoint, which validates your credentials and returns the token.

```r
# obtain a token using resource_owner
# supply credentials in username and password args
get_azure_token("myresource", "mytenant", "app_id",
                username="myusername", password="mypassword", auth_type="resource_owner")
```

If you don't specify the method, `get_azure_token` makes a best guess based on the presence or absence of the other authentication arguments, and whether httpuv is installed.

```r
# this will default to authorization_code if httpuv is installed, and device_code if not
get_azure_token("myresource", "mytenant", "app_id")
```


## Caching

AzureAuth caches tokens based on all the inputs to `get_azure_token`, as listed above. It defines its own directory for cached tokens, using the rappdirs package. On recent Windows versions, this will usually be in the location `C:\Users\(username)\AppData\Local\AzureR`. On Linux, it will be in `~/.local/share/AzureR`, and on MacOS, it will be in `~/Library/Application Support/AzureR`. Note that a single directory is used for all tokens, and the working directory is not touched (which significantly lessens the risk of accidentally introducing cached tokens into source control).

For reasons of CRAN policy, AzureAuth will ask you for permission to create this directory. Unless you have a specific reason otherwise, it's recommended that you allow the directory to be created. Note that most other cloud engineering tools save credentials in this way, including Docker, Kubernetes, and the Azure CLI itself.

To list all cached tokens on disk, use `list_azure_tokens`. This returns a list of token objects, named according to their MD5 hashes.

To delete a cached token, use `delete_azure_token`. This takes the same inputs as `get_azure_token`, or you can specify the MD5 hash directly in the `hash` argument. To delete _all_ cached tokens, use `clean_token_directory`.

```r
# list all tokens
list_azure_tokens()

# <... list of token objects ...>

# delete a token
delete_azure_token("myresource", "mytenant", "app_id",
                   password="client_credentials", auth_type="client_credentials")
```
