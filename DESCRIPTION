Description: Provides Azure Active Directory authentication functionality for R users of Microsoft's 'Azure' cloud. Use this package to obtain 'OAuth' 2.0 tokens for services including Azure Resource Manager, Azure Storage and others. Multiple authentication methods are supported, including device code and resource owner grant. Tokens are cached in a user-specific directory obtained using the rappdirs package. The interface is based on the OAuth framework in the httr package, but customised and streamlined for Azure.
